    <p class="postMargins">Web is a class I took in my Freshman Year of college. This class is an introduction to the coding languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This very website you are viewing was the midterm project for this web class. In this class, I learned from the ground up the fundamentals of these coding languages and how to use them to create my very own website. Please enjoy walking through the visual progress of my coding journey.</p>
