    <p class="postMargins">Image is a class I took in my Freshman Year of college. This class is an introduction to the world of images. However, this class wasn't just about snapping photos. This class covered photography, photo editing, Photoshop, and even basic animation. We even covered some of the history and deeper side of photography and images. The projects and challenges this class presented me were "out of this world" fun and I am so excited to share them with you!</p>
