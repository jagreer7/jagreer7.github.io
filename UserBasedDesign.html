    <p class="postMargins">Design Foundations is a class I took in my Freshman Year of college. This class served as a way for students to learn about the fundamentals of design. What makes a design good? What makes a design not good? Ultimately, for me, the class was a way for me to use those fundamentals to start working on wonderful designs. Funny enough, the links below are to project posts on an alternate website that was created as a part of the Design Foundations course. Not as cool as this site (which I coded by hand), but an interesting look into the design foundations past.</p>
