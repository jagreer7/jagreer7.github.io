      <p>This is a larger scale, end to end, design project. The task, design something to enhance those times when you’re alone. Waiting for the bus, hanging before class, sitting in line.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The project starts with the first step, Observation. I needed to take note of the times when I am alone. What do I do? What Habits? What activities? Using this information, along with those of my group, we could create a potential idea of how we could enhance this time. The observation is here:

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The second step is breaking down these observations into two key parts. The POV map and the empathy map.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The empathy map takes the observations and breaks them into parts like “What are the activities we do while were alone?”, and “Why do we do these things?”.
