      <strong><em>December 9th, 2021</em></strong>
      <p>This is a larger scale, end to end, design project. The task, design something to enhance those times when you’re alone. Waiting for the bus, hanging before class, sitting in line.</p>
      <p>
        The project starts with the first step, Observation. I needed to take note of the times when I am alone. What do I do? What Habits? What activities? Using this information, along with those of my group, we could create a potential idea of how we could enhance this time. The observation is here:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <a href="https://jagreer7.github.io/pdfs/ATLS1100_Obs2_Greer.pdf"download> Download My Observations as .pdf</a>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The second step is breaking down these observations into two key parts. The <strong>POV map</strong> and the <strong>empathy map</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The empathy map takes the observations and breaks them into parts like “What are the activities we do while were alone?”, and “Why do we do these things?”.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/EmpathyMap.png" alt = "A photograph of an empathy map">
      <br>
      <p>
        Then the POV map sought to explore the things we feel, think, say, and do while we’re alone.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/POVMap.png" alt = "A photograph of a POV map">
      <br>
      <p>
        Using these maps we generated three potential problem statements and selected one to design a solution for.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People meaninglessly check their phones more often when alone, most often too little success</li>
        <li>People don’t use their time alone in a meaningful way</li>
        <li><strong>People struggle to find significant uses for their time alone, especially when there is little time to weigh meaningful options.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Next using our problem statement for further analysis, we used ideation to create a solution. We brainstormed weird silly ideas and even combined some together to make weirder potential ideas. Our ideas included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Puzzle recommendations</li>
        <li>Journal meant to keep your mind going</li>
        <li>An app that encourages you to get out and meet people</li>
        <li>Arts and craft projects</li>
        <li>The thing that takes away distractions so you do your homework</li>
        <li>Game in VR that feels social even if you’re not directly talking</li>
        <li>Robotic Shia</li>
        <li>Daily quotes</li>
        <li>Digital coloring book</li>
        <li>Life questions to think about</li>
        <li>Pretty views near your location</li>
        <li>Baking app</li>
        <li>Decision-maker twister</li>
        <li>Netflix recommender</li>
        <li>Bad habits counter</li>
        <li>Virtual daily short story</li>
        <li>5-minute news updates</li>
        <li>Adventure recommender</li>
        <li>Life goals maker</li>
        <li>Robot friend ❤</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        By combining these solutions we created a solution to our problem statement. Our idea was an app that would allow its user to take a short quiz detailing the amount of time they have (5-15 minutes) and then provide the user with a meaningful activity to do for that time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Next comes the fun part: <strong>Prototyping!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Physical prototypes included things like drawings of the home screen, menu paths, mascots, color palettes, and the personalization quiz.
      </p>
      <div class="prototypesGrid">
        <div class="prototype1">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/quiz.png" alt = "A scan of a Personalization Quiz Prototype">
          <h6>
            Personalization Quiz Prototype (Made by me)
          </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="prototype2">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/Colors.png" alt = "A photograph of Color Palette Prototypes">
          <h6>
            Color Palette Prototypes (Made by me)
          </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="prototype3">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/Logos.png" alt = "A photograph of Logo Prototypes">
          <h6>
            Logo Prototypes (Made by me)
          </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="prototype4">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/HomeScreens.png" alt = "A photograph of a Paper Home Screen Prototype">
          <h6>
            Paper Home Screen Prototype (Made By Group Member)
          </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="prototype5">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/menuBranches.png" alt = "A photograph of a Menu Branch prototype">
          <h6>
            Menu Branches (Made by Group Member)
          </h6>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Using these physical prototypes we could test with potential users of the app to see what was best. Do users like quizzes that scroll left to right or up and down? What color palette is best? Which home screen is the most inviting? These were all answered by user testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital Prototypes served as a way for us to put our physical prototypes together into a digital version. Then we could user test the digital versions to create the best final digital prototype. Here were some of the digital prototypes:
      </p>
      <div class="prototypesGrid">
        <div class="prototype1">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/ChosenLogo.png" alt = "A photograph of the chosen logo">
        </div>
        <div class="prototype2">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/midQuiz.png" alt = "A photograph of the quiz made with Adobe XD">
          <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/84b6e8b3-c7d2-40ab-98af-c9ac0117afda-d1e5/"> Experience with Adobe XD</a>
        </div>
        <div class="prototype3">
          <img class="centerForPosts" src="img/midHome.png" alt = "A photograph of The homescreen">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We then user-tested to get feedback on things like color choices, font choices, and styles. For example, the purple and yellow quiz got feedback such as the quiz style is good but the color choice is bad.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Finally, we made a final interactive prototype. This included a home screen similar to the digital test, with updated colors based on our user testing. The font went through a lot of different styles, deciding between a more playful font which might deter some users, or a professional font to fit more modern looks. Bright colors create an eyecatcher app, or muted colors to make the app more usable.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The final product is viewable here:
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
        The last and most important step is feedback. The feedback we received was something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main problem is with concept, ensuring that the design we made really solves the problem of the user</li>
        <li>The font choice is good in some cases but can be overwhelming when certain pages have several different fonts</li>
        <li>The design process is present and you can see clearly the phases that were taken</li>
        <li>Pages like the store are good becasue of their use of the title font and simple design</li>
      </ul>
