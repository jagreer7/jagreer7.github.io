        <h4 class="underline"> Who am I? </h4>
          <p>
            I guess I could be labelled as a lot of things. I’m a male, Asian, 5’10”, walks on two feet, etc…
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course I’m more than those things on the outside.
            I’m a brother, a student, a learner, a friend to all, a
            Pokémon hunter, an Eagle Scout, a video game collector, a
            wannabe designer and a succulent caregiver. I spend my free
            time doing homework and playing video games. I love food and
            the history and science which surrounds it. In a lot of ways
            I am confident I am just like you. And I can guarantee there’s
            a million ways I am nothing like you. But doesn’t that make our
            journey together all the merrier?

        <h4 class="underline"> My Goals for the course </h4>
        <p>
          I am truly excited to continue exploring coding languages,
          especially those realted to web development. My goal for the course
          is to devote my time and work into truly understanding the coding languages
          as well as learning how I can utlize the skills from this class
          in my future.
