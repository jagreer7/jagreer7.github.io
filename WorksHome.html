        <p>"Web" is a class I took in the Spring of 2022. This class is an introduction to the coding languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This very website you are viewing was the midterm project for this web class. In this class, I learned from the ground up the fundamentals of these coding languages and how to use them to create my very own website. Please enjoy walking through the visual progress of my coding journey.</p><br>

        <p>"Image" is a class I took in the Spring of 2022. This class is an introduction to the world of images. However, this class wasn't just about snapping photos. This class covered photography, photo editing, Photoshop, and even basic animation. We even covered some of the history and deeper side of photography and images. The projects and challenges this class presented me were "out of this world" fun and I am so excited to share them with you!</p><br>

        <p>"Design Foundations" is a class I took in the Fall of 2021. This class served as a way for students to learn about the fundamentals of design. What makes a design good? What makes a design not good? Ultimately, for me, the class was a way for me to use those fundamentals to start working on wonderful designs. Funny enough, the links below are to project posts on an alternate website that was created as a part of the Design Foundations course. Not as cool as this site (which I coded by hand), but an interesting look into the design foundations past.</p><br>
